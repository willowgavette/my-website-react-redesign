		"firstDesc": "Hi, I'm Willow! I'm a full-stack software engineer who is passionate about programming, code optimization, and algorithm design. I'm focused, driven, detail-oriented, and one of the hardest workers you'll ever meet. In my spare time, I enjoy going to the gym, reading, and converting an old Uhaul box truck into a camper!",
		"secondDesc": "I am always learning new technologies as well as trying to improve my skills with the tech I already know. The process of designing software and then expanding and optimizing it is one of my strongest loves. When I'm not coding, I'm thinking about coding!"
